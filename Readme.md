## An e-commerce website with basic functionalities

- I have created a shop cart which has some basic functionalities that an e-commerce application have by using Vanilla JS
- It has given me great experience of how to design frontend and request data from api and fetch the data.
- It took me 3 days to make this project which includes solving problems using stack-overflow and learning concepts like routes.
- For getting product images , description , price I have used fakestore api.
